# AD-MPC: Asynchronous Dynamic MPC with Guaranteed Output Delivery

Asynchronous Dynamic MPC (AD‑MPC) extends dynamic MPC protocols to fully asynchronous networks while guaranteeing output delivery (GOD) under the optimal resilience (n = 3t + 1). This repository contains an implementation of AD‑MPC.

## Setup

1. Ensure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is installed and the daemon is running.

2. Move into the project root:
   ```bash
   cd ADMPC
   ```

3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t admpc:latest .
   ```
   > **Note:** If you are on macOS with Apple Silicon (M‑series) and need an `arm64` image, you can instead run  
   > ```bash
   > docker buildx build --platform=linux/arm64 -t admpc:arm64 .
   > ```


## Running AD‑MPC locally

The helper script `local_admpc_run.sh` spins up one process per **node × layer** (or per node for HoneyBadgerMPC) on the same machine and writes all stdout/stderr to `logs/`.  
Below are several one‑line commands to run common local experiments.

1. **Enter a container (if not already inside one)**  
   ```bash
   docker run -it admpc:latest bash
   ```

2. **Quick start – AD‑MPC**  
   ```bash
   ./local_admpc_run.sh admpc 4 1 8 300
   ```  
   This launches 4 nodes with fault threshold 1 on an 8‑layer circuit containing 300 multiplication gates.  
   Timing results are aggregated into `extracted_times.csv` and `summary_times.csv`; per‑process logs appear under `logs/`.

3. **Fluid‑MPC baselines**  
   ```bash
   ./local_admpc_run.sh fluid1 4 1 10 300   # Fluid MPC (variant 1)
   ./local_admpc_run.sh fluid2 4 1 10 300   # Fluid MPC (variant 2)
   ```  
   Output is recorded in `logs/` as above.

4. **HoneyBadger‑MPC baseline & attack scenario**  
   ```bash
   # Honest execution
   ./local_admpc_run.sh hbmpc 4 1 6 300

   # Simulate an honest node going offline (e.g., at layer 3)
   ./local_admpc_run.sh hbmpc_attack 4 1 6 300
   ```  
   Output is recorded in `logs/` as above.
## Distributed deployment on Tencent Cloud

All orchestration commands are run **inside a local container** so your host machine only needs Docker and SSH.

```bash
# On your local machine
docker run -it admpc:latest bash
```

### 1. Provision servers & security groups

* Launch one Tencent Cloud CVM for **each committee member in every circuit layer** (i.e., `layers × N` instances).  
* Open the required ports (TCP 7001‑7013, 22, ICMP/ICMPv6, etc.) with the helper script:

```bash
python scripts/apply_security_group.py   # edit SecretId / SecretKey first
```

### 2. Register node IPs

Edit the arrays `NODE_IPS` and `NODE_NUM` in  
`scripts/config.sh`, `scripts/setup_ssh_keys.sh`, and `scripts/create_json_files.sh`.

### 3. Generate node configuration files

```bash
cd scripts

# w = 100, vary circuit depth d ∈ {2,4,6,8,10}
./batch_create_d.sh

# Sweep N‑t pairs (layers=8, total_cm=300)
./batch_create_json.sh

# Experiments with fixed product w·d ∈ {600, 960, 1200}
./batch_create_wd.sh
```

### 4. Configure password‑less SSH

```bash
./setup_ssh_keys.sh
```

### 5. Distribute code & Docker image

```bash
./distribute-docker.sh
```

### 6. Launch the protocol

```bash
./control-node.sh <config_dir> [protocol] 
```

`config_dir` is the folder generated by the batch scripts (e.g., `admpc_300_6_16`).  
If the remote servers do not yet have the AD‑MPC Docker image, the script automatically triggers a build via `docker-compose` before starting the containers.  
Output is streamed back to `scripts/logs/` on your local machine.
